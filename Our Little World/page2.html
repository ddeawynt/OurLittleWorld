      <p class="fade-in-section">I met you in a way I never expected, like the wind that arrives unannounced, only felt, never seen. We first crossed paths in a simple place called the Guidance Counseling room. At first, we just exchanged glances, silently wondering, 'Who are you?' My curiosity was piqued by your certificates and that's where our conversation began. Lighthearted chats about anime, music, and K-Pop brought us closer. We exchanged contacts, and since then, you've slowly become someone important in my life.</p>

      <p class="fade-in-section">Time passed, and eventually, we graduated. I never imagined I'd be loved by someone as intelligent, as sincere, and as amazing as you, with so many achievements. I still remember when the four of us hung out at Cafe Tutur; everything felt normal, like any other friendship. But that day, you gave me an unforgettable experience: holding a girl's hand for the first time in my life. I was nervous then because everything felt new, and honestly, I didn't know how to act.</p>

      <p class="fade-in-section">Day by day, you started contacting me more often and initially, it all felt quite ordinary. But over time, I realized there was something in the way you paid attention to me. Until finally, you confessed your feelings. I was surprised and happy, even though at that moment, I couldn't reciprocate with the same intensity. We continued to communicate, getting to know each other more deeply, until one time we had a conflict. I wanted everything to be okay, so I asked you to walk that night, just to resolve everything maturely. But that night, you touched my heart with the gentle way you looked at me, as if silently telling me you wanted me to know your heart was truly sincere.</p>

      <p class="fade-in-section">That night, I also realized that my feelings were starting to grow. You slowly opened my heart, which I had purposely kept tightly closed all this time. I always thought love was painful, so I refused to feel it. But you were different; you arrived bringing warmth, like a bonfire in the middle of winter. I started loving you not because of your appearance or your achievements, but because of the way you touched my soul with your patient, gentle, and loving demeanor.</p>

      <p class="fade-in-section">Now I can say I love you. I love your chubby cheeks, your sweet smile, your honest gaze, and your words that can always calm my heart. You've shown me that love can appear in a simple yet meaningful way. Thank you for being someone who could gently knock on and open my heart. I'm grateful to have met you, Dea, and more than that, I'm happy to be able to love you.</p>
